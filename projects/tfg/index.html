	<span class="title">Multiplayer environment (Summary)</span><br>
	This document the technical proposal for the implementation of a multiplayer environment of a Shooter video game.<br><br>
	Will proceed with the creation of a database and implementing a server application that will communicates with the game client (made with Unity3d). In addition, the necessary infrastructure for the management and creation of user accounts will be created through a website. The video game will use the mechanics and other elements developed by other partners. The database will be created with PostgreSQL and the server with a C# console application.<br><br>
	In addition to the multiplayer system and their game modes, a maze generator will be created, that will take part on the design of one of the maps that will be used in the matches.<br><br>
	To evaluate the proper functioning of the game and the infrastructure, tests will be done with multiple, simultaneous, clients.<br><br>
	You should fill the cells of the board with the help of the numbers at the top and left sides to discover a hidden picture.<br>

	<span class="title">Project context</span><br>
	- Database: stores user accounts and game statistics.<br>
	- Webpage: allows the users to create new accounts and manage the existent ones.<br>
	- Server app: bridge between the clients and the database. Everything that a client needs from the database should be asked to the server.<br>
	- Game Launcher: a simple application that helps to maintain the final game client up to date.<br>
	- Game Client: video game demo created with Unity3D that uses the other developed tools in addition to UNet to create a multiplayer mode.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="title">Tools used</span><br>
	- PostgreSQL and pgAdmin III<br>
	- Visual Studio Community 2015 (C#)<br>
	- Unity3D<br>
	- Ccheck memory chapter 3 section 5 for more.<br>
