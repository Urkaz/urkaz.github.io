	<span class="title">What is Arrow Defense?</span><br>
	Arrow Defense is a project for "Design and Developent of Web Games" subject, and the result was exported to Android.<br>
	In the game, you are under siege in your castle, and the enemy is shooting lots of arrows. You need to protect yourself surviving the attack or counterattacking with the same weapon, the arrows.<br>
	<br>
	Tap the arrows on the screen to break them, and do it in the bottom panel to collect (obtaining twice the normal points) and make combos to counterattack.<br><br>
	<img class="mid" src="img/tap1.png"></img>
	<br>
	<span class="title">Level types</span><br>
	There are three level types, all sharing the same mechanic but changing the victory conditions.<br>
	<br>
	- Time levels: Survive until time runs out. You can break, collect and make combos with the arrows to obtain a high score.<br>
	- Life levels: Attack your enemy with combos to make them retreat (until the next level!). Each combo will decrease the enemy life points.<br>
	- Combo levels: For some reason, you can only win this battle (not the war) making specific combos with the enemy arrows.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="title">Arrows and Combos</span><br>
	Six different type of arrows will fall from the sky, sent by your enemy.<br>
	<div class="mid">
		<img src="img/normal.png"></img>
		<img src="img/fire.png"></img>
		<img src="img/ice.png"></img>
		<img src="img/electric.png"></img>
		<img src="img/fast.png"></img>
		<img src="img/plant.png"></img>
	</div>
	- <span class="gray">Normal</span>: The most common arrow, without anything special.<br>
	- <span class="red">Fire</span>: Burning arrow.<br>
	- <span class="blue">Ice</span>: Frozen arrow.<br>
	- <span class="yellow">Lightning</span>: Arrow charged with electricity.<br>
	- <span class="purple">Quick</span>: An arrow that falls faster than any other one.<br>
	- <span class="green">Plant</span>: Wooden arrow with some plant growing from it.<br>
	<br>One of the planned featured was to include special effects caused by the specal arrows (both beneficial and harmful) to the field and soldiers. This is planned to be implemented on the furure.<br>
	<br>
	As mentioned before, touching the arrows in the bottom panel will collect them, allowing to make some combos. All are combinations of two or three specific arrows:<br>
	<br>
	- <span class="purple">Quick</span> attack: 2 <span class="gray">Normal</span> + 1 <span class="purple">Quick</span>.<br>
	- <span class="red">Fire</span> attack: 2 <span class="gray">Normal</span> + 1 <span class="red">Fire</span>.<br>
	- <span class="blue">Ice</span>-<span class="red">Fire</span> attack: 1 <span class="red">Fire</span> + 1 <span class="blue">Ice</span>.<br>
	- <span class="yellow">Lightning</span> attack: 1 <span class="yellow">Lightning</span> + 1 <span class="purple">Quick</span>.<br>
	- <span class="yellow">Lightning</span>-<span class="red">Fire</span> attack: 1 <span class="yellow">Lightning</span> + 1 <span class="red">Fire</span>.<br>
	<br>
	PS: The combos are not shown on the screen! Sorry about that! D:<br>
